## Summary
This project outlines the measures undertaken to help a credit card company to identify its customer segments to strengthen customer retention and revenue through some suggested marketing strategies the team has developed. 

The team used a credit card transactions dataset and performed pre-processing techniques in order to clean, engineer features, and handle outliers. Additionally, the team first performed exploratory data analysis to better understand the dataset and identify potential relationships among the variables. Subsequently, the team performed K-means clustering to segment the customers and identified four distinct customer segments through behavioural analysis. The customer segments are Cash Advance Customers, Active Micro-Purchasers, Conservative Customers and Active Customers. 

After profiling the customer segments, each segment's profitability and loyalty were analysed using an adapted McKinsey Portfolio Matrix, which allowed the team to provide tailored recommendations to create the most effective and efficient marketing strategy for each segment and thus, helping ABC Co. to potentially achieve higher profitability and customer retention.
